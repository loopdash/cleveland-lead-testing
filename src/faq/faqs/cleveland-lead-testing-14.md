<h2>Can lead be found in Cleveland’s drinking water?</h2>
<p>Yes—while municipal water is treated, <strong>household plumbing</strong> may introduce lead into tap water, especially in homes built before 1986 with lead service lines or solder. For property owners and investors, testing water in older rentals can help identify risk and guide practical controls.</p>
<h3>When to be concerned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-1986 plumbing with lead service lines or lead solder</li>
  <li>Stagnant water after long periods of non-use</li>
  <li>Visible corrosion or disturbed plumbing work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to reduce risk</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Arrange <strong>first-draw and flushed water sampling</strong> with a certified lab.</li>
  <li>Flush taps after periods of disuse; use <strong>NSF/ANSI 53</strong>-certified filters where needed.</li>
  <li>Consult Cleveland Water Department resources on service line identification and replacement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Water testing complements paint and dust controls, creating a comprehensive <strong>lead-safe housing</strong> strategy for Cleveland portfolios.</p>
