<h2>What are the symptoms of lead exposure in children?</h2>
<p>Many children with elevated blood lead levels show <strong>no obvious symptoms</strong>, which is why proactive testing is critical. When symptoms do occur, they can include developmental delays, learning difficulties, irritability, appetite and weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, hearing issues, and in severe cases seizures. Because damage can be permanent, Cleveland property owners and investors should focus on prevention in pre-1978 buildings.</p>
<h3>Common signs to watch for</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developmental delays and learning challenges</li>
  <li>Behavioral changes, irritability, and fatigue</li>
  <li>Stomach pain, constipation, or vomiting</li>
  <li>Hearing problems and, rarely, seizures</li>
</ul>
<h3>How owners can help prevent exposure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Maintain paint and friction surfaces; repair quickly when deterioration appears.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>lead-safe work practices</strong> and confirm safety with clearance dust-wipe testing.</li>
  <li>Educate residents about routine pediatric testing and wet cleaning methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pairing pediatric screening with a rigorous property maintenance plan helps keep Cleveland rentals lead-safe for families.</p>
