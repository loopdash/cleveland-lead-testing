title: How does lead dust get created in homes?
description: Understanding the process of lead dust generation from friction between painted surfaces

short_answer: Lead dust forms when painted surfaces rub together (windows, doors). Friction creates dust that can be inhaled or ingested, with just a teaspoon causing serious harm.

<h2>How does lead dust get created in homes?</h2>
<p><strong>Friction and impact</strong> are the primary culprits. When painted surfaces rub or bang—like <strong>windows</strong> sliding in their tracks, <strong>doors</strong> closing in frames, or <strong>stairs and railings</strong> seeing daily wear—lead paint can break down into fine dust. This dust settles on floors and sills or becomes airborne, where it can be inhaled or ingested by children. Even <strong>tiny amounts</strong>—less than a teaspoon, about the size of a sugar packet—can cause serious harm.</p>
<h3>High-risk locations to monitor</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows and sash channels</strong> (opening/closing causes grinding)</li>
  <li><strong>Door edges and frames</strong> (constant impact and rubbing)</li>
  <li><strong>Stairs, railings, and banisters</strong> (heavy traffic and contact)</li>
  <li><strong>Exterior painted surfaces</strong> (weathering creates chips and dust that migrate indoors)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Action steps for owners and investors</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stabilize deteriorated paint and address friction points; consider window replacement where feasible.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>lead-safe work practices</strong>, contain work areas, and clean with HEPA vacuums.</li>
  <li>Conduct <strong>clearance dust-wipe testing</strong> after work and at unit turn to verify safety.</li>
  <li>Educate residents on wet cleaning of floors and sills to keep dust levels low.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reducing friction and confirming results with clearance tests are the most reliable ways to control lead dust in Cleveland’s older rentals.</p>
