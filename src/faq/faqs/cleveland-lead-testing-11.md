<h2>How often should children in Cleveland be tested for lead?</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends blood lead testing at <strong>12 months</strong> and <strong>24 months</strong>, with catch-up testing between <strong>ages 3–6</strong> if not previously tested. Children living in pre-1978 housing or with known hazards may need more frequent tests. For landlords and investors, encouraging testing helps protect residents and supports stable tenancy in older buildings.</p>
<h3>When to test</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Routine screens at 12 and 24 months</li>
  <li>Additional tests if a child lives in a <strong>pre-1978</strong> unit or if hazards are present</li>
  <li>Follow-up testing when exposure is suspected or after hazard control</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner guidance</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Provide residents with information about local testing resources.</li>
  <li>Maintain units using <strong>lead-safe practices</strong> to minimize risk between screenings.</li>
  <li>Document hazard corrections and <strong>clearance results</strong> after work orders and turns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regular pediatric testing, combined with proactive property maintenance, reduces risk in Cleveland’s older housing stock.</p>
