<h2>How can I find out if my home has lead hazards?</h2>
<p>The most reliable method is to hire a <strong>certified lead risk assessor</strong> to evaluate your Cleveland property. A risk assessment identifies deteriorated paint, friction points, and dust or soil hazards, and it recommends specific controls. For landlords and investors, formal testing supports compliance, reduces liability, and informs capital planning for older assets.</p>
<h3>Testing options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lead inspection:</strong> Determines where lead-based paint is present using XRF or lab analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk assessment:</strong> Evaluates actual hazards (paint condition, dust, soil) and prioritizes fixes.</li>
  <li><strong>Clearance testing:</strong> Confirms dust levels are safe after repairs, cleaning, or tenant turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Contact the <strong>Lead Safe Resource Center</strong> to locate certified assessors.</li>
  <li>Scope high-risk areas: windows, doors, stairs, porches, basements.</li>
  <li>Plan repairs using <strong>lead-safe work practices</strong> and budget for clearance testing.</li>
  <li>Maintain documentation for <strong>lead-safe certification</strong> and leasing packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Proactive testing gives you a clear roadmap to make your Cleveland rental or investment property lead-safe and market-ready.</p>
