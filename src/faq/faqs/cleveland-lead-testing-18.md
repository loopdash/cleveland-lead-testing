<h2>What is lead abatement and when is it necessary?</h2>
<p><strong>Lead abatement</strong> permanently eliminates lead hazards through removal, replacement, or durable enclosure. It goes beyond routine maintenance or interim controls. In Cleveland, abatement may be necessary when hazards are severe, repeatedly recur, or when projects (like window replacement) are planned and offer a cost‑effective opportunity to eliminate sources of dust.</p>
<h3>Common abatement methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Removal</strong> of lead-based paint and dust</li>
  <li><strong>Replacement</strong> of windows, doors, or trim creating dust</li>
  <li><strong>Enclosure</strong> with durable coverings where removal isn’t practical</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to consider abatement</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Persistent hazards that return despite repairs and cleaning</li>
  <li>Major rehab projects offering economies of scale</li>
  <li>High-risk units housing families with young children</li>
</ol>
<p>Abatement must be performed by certified professionals and should conclude with <strong>clearance testing</strong> to verify safety across your rental portfolio.</p>
