<h2>Who is most at risk for lead exposure in Cleveland?</h2>
<p><strong>Children under 6</strong> face the greatest risk because their brains and nervous systems are still developing and they frequently engage in hand‑to‑mouth behavior. Pregnant people are also vulnerable due to risks to the fetus. In Cleveland’s older housing, families in rental units can be disproportionately affected by deteriorated paint and dust. For <strong>property owners and investors</strong>, prioritizing lead-safe practices protects residents and strengthens compliance and leasing outcomes.</p>
<h3>Groups at highest risk</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Children under age 6</strong> and infants</li>
  <li><strong>Pregnant people</strong> and those planning pregnancy</li>
  <li>Families living in <strong>pre-1978 rentals</strong> with peeling paint or friction surfaces</li>
  <li>Households with frequent renovations or DIY projects in older homes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner and investor checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Schedule routine <strong>lead risk assessments</strong> and address hazards promptly.</li>
  <li>Maintain windows, doors, and stairs to reduce dust generation.</li>
  <li>Provide tenant education on <strong>wet cleaning</strong> and regular handwashing for children.</li>
  <li>Use certified professionals and confirm safety with <strong>clearance testing</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Targeting these preventative steps keeps Cleveland rentals safer for children and helps owners meet regulatory expectations while preserving asset performance.</p>
