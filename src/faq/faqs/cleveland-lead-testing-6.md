<h2>How much lead dust is dangerous?</h2>
<p>Even <strong>small amounts</strong> of lead dust can be hazardous—less than a teaspoon (about a sugar packet) can contribute to elevated blood lead levels in children. Because dust is often invisible, the safest approach for Cleveland <strong>property owners, landlords, and investors</strong> is routine testing and preventive maintenance rather than relying on visual checks alone.</p>
<h3>Key considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lead dust accumulates on <strong>floors, windowsills, and troughs</strong> where children crawl and play.</li>
  <li>Normal activities like opening <strong>windows</strong> and shutting <strong>doors</strong> can generate new dust daily.</li>
  <li>Only <strong>clearance dust-wipe tests</strong> can confirm safe levels after repairs or cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner action steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Implement <strong>wet cleaning</strong> protocols and HEPA vacuuming for common areas and unit turns.</li>
  <li>Repair deteriorated paint and stabilize friction surfaces to prevent dust generation.</li>
  <li>Require <strong>clearance testing</strong> after work and maintain documentation for compliance and leasing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consistent controls and verification protect families and support smooth operations in Cleveland’s pre-1978 housing.</p>
