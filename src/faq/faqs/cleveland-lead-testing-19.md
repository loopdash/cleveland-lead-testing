<h2>What are landlords’ responsibilities regarding lead in Cleveland?</h2>
<p>Landlords must disclose known lead hazards, <strong>maintain properties</strong> to prevent deterioration, and address hazards when identified. Cleveland’s lead-safe expectations mean owners should plan for testing, repairs, and documentation to demonstrate that rentals are safe for families—especially those with young children.</p>
<h3>Key obligations for owners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide <strong>disclosures</strong> about known lead hazards</li>
  <li>Maintain paint and building components to prevent dust</li>
  <li>Use <strong>lead-safe work practices</strong> during repairs and renovations</li>
  <li>Complete <strong>clearance testing</strong> after work and at unit turn, retaining records</li>
</ul>
<h3>Practical steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Schedule <strong>lead risk assessments</strong> for pre-1978 units and common areas.</li>
  <li>Prioritize windows, doors, stairs, and exterior trim for repairs or replacement.</li>
  <li>Educate tenants on wet cleaning and promptly address peeling paint work orders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Proactive compliance protects residents, reduces liability, and improves leasing outcomes across Cleveland rentals.</p>
