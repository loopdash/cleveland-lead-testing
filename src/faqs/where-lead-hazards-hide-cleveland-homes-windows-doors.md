<h2>Common lead hazard locations in Cleveland residential properties</h2>
<p>Lead-based paint may be buried under newer coatings in many pre-1978 homes. When intact, it’s usually not an immediate hazard—but <strong>deterioration</strong> and <strong>friction</strong> create dangerous dust and chips. For property owners and investors, inspecting these hotspots prevents tenant exposure and supports lead-safe certifications.</p>
<h3>Common hazard locations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows and windowsills</strong> (sliding creates dust in troughs)</li>
  <li><strong>Doors and door frames</strong> (rubbing and impact)</li>
  <li><strong>Stairs, railings, and banisters</strong> (high wear areas)</li>
  <li><strong>Porches and exterior trim</strong> (weathering and flaking)</li>
  <li><strong>Basements</strong> with chipping paint on walls or columns</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practices for owners</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stabilize deteriorated paint using lead-safe methods; consider <strong>window replacement</strong>.</li>
  <li>Clean frequently with <strong>wet methods</strong> and HEPA vacuums; avoid dry sweeping.</li>
  <li>Confirm results with <strong>clearance dust-wipe testing</strong>, especially at unit turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Focusing on these locations reduces the greatest share of risk in Cleveland rentals and small multifamily buildings.</p>
