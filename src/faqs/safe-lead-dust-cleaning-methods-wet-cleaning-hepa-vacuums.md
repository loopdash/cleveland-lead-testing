<h2>Safe lead dust cleaning methods and prevention strategies</h2>
<p>Use <strong>wet cleaning</strong> techniques and HEPA filtration to keep dust levels low. Dry sweeping or standard dusting can spread lead dust into the air and onto surfaces where children play. In Cleveland’s pre-1978 rentals and investment properties, establishing a consistent cleaning protocol protects residents and supports compliance efforts.</p>
<h3>Lead-safe cleaning checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean floors and windowsills with warm water and detergent; rinse frequently.</li>
  <li>Use a <strong>HEPA vacuum</strong> on floors, rugs, and window troughs; avoid brooms without HEPA.</li>
  <li>Focus on friction areas (windows, doors) and child play zones.</li>
  <li>Launder cleaning cloths separately; wash children’s hands often, especially before meals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner tips</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Provide residents with simple instructions and supplies at move-in.</li>
  <li>Perform deep cleans and <strong>clearance testing</strong> after repairs and at turns.</li>
  <li>Fix deteriorated paint promptly to address dust at the source.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cleaning alone is not enough—pair it with repairs and verification to maintain a <strong>lead-safe rental</strong> in Cleveland.</p>
