<h2>Lead Safe Certification requirements and process for Cleveland landlords</h2>
<p>Starting March 31, 2021, the City of Cleveland requires all residential rental units built before 1978 to obtain a <strong>Lead Safe Certification</strong>. This certification ensures that lead hazards have been controlled so that lead dust concentrations remain below EPA thresholds. For property owners and investors, this is not just complianceâ€”it's protecting families and preserving asset value.</p>
<h3>The 6-step certification process</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Contact the Resource Center:</strong> Call 833.601.5323 or email lsrc@ehw.org for guidance</li>
  <li><strong>Check your property:</strong> Inspect for deteriorating paint on windows, doors, stairs, and railings</li>
  <li><strong>Remediate hazards:</strong> Fix deteriorated paint using lead-safe work practices</li>
  <li><strong>Clean your property:</strong> Thorough cleaning before clearance examination</li>
  <li><strong>Get lead clearance:</strong> Schedule independent clearance examination by certified professional</li>
  <li><strong>Apply for certification:</strong> Submit clearance report to City of Cleveland</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key requirements for owners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All pre-1978 rental units must be certified</li>
  <li>Clearance examiner must be independent (not the same as remediation contractor)</li>
  <li>Application must be submitted within 30 days of inspection</li>
  <li>Financial assistance available through CHN Housing Partners</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this process protects your tenants, ensures compliance, and maintains the marketability of your Cleveland rental properties. <strong>Ready to begin your certification journey?</strong> <a href="tel:2164400321" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Call or text (216) 440-0321</a> to schedule your initial lead inspection and get professional guidance on the certification process.</p>
