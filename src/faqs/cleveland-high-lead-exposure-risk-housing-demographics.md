<h2>Why Cleveland faces elevated lead exposure risk</h2>
<p>Cleveland’s risk is driven by its <strong>older housing stock</strong>: more than 90% of rental units were built before 1978, when lead paint was banned. That means many properties contain legacy lead-based paint that can deteriorate and generate dust. For <strong>property owners, landlords, and investors</strong>, this context makes a proactive lead testing and maintenance plan essential to keep units habitable, reduce liability, and protect portfolio performance—especially in high-turn or value-add investments.</p>
<h3>Core drivers of risk</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-1978 construction:</strong> widespread presence of lead-based paint in walls, trim, windows, and doors.</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred maintenance:</strong> peeling or damaged paint and friction surfaces generating lead dust.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic pressure:</strong> limited resources for major repairs can delay hazard control.</li>
  <li><strong>Family exposure:</strong> children under 6 are most vulnerable to long-term harm from dust exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner and investor response</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Integrate <strong>lead risk assessments</strong> into acquisition due diligence and capital planning.</li>
  <li>Stabilize paint, replace failing windows, and maintain door and stair systems to reduce dust.</li>
  <li>Perform <strong>clearance testing</strong> after work and at every turn to confirm safe dust levels.</li>
  <li>Educate residents on wet cleaning and promptly address work orders that could disturb paint.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these steps helps ensure compliance, protects families, and supports the long-term value of Cleveland investment properties.</p>
