<h2>Lead Safe Certification requirements for multi-unit properties in Cleveland</h2>
<p>For property owners with multiple rental units, Lead Safe Certification applies to <strong>every unit built before 1978</strong>. However, the clearance examination process is streamlined for larger properties to make compliance more manageable. For investors and landlords with multi-unit portfolios, understanding these requirements helps with planning and budgeting for certification across all properties.</p>
<h3>Requirements for all multi-unit properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Every unit must be remediated:</strong> All pre-1978 units require lead hazard control</li>
  <li><strong>All units must be certified:</strong> No exceptions for multi-unit properties</li>
  <li><strong>Same standards apply:</strong> Each unit must meet the same safety requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Timeline compliance:</strong> All units must be certified by their respective deadlines</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clearance examination for large properties</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Properties with 20+ units:</strong> Clearance examiners randomly check a portion of units</li>
  <li><strong>Sampling approach:</strong> Not every unit needs individual clearance examination</li>
  <li><strong>Representative testing:</strong> Selected units represent the overall property condition</li>
  <li><strong>Full compliance still required:</strong> All units must eventually be certified</li>
</ol>
<h3>Planning considerations for multi-unit owners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritize units based on condition and tenant turnover</li>
  <li>Coordinate work across multiple units for efficiency</li>
  <li>Budget for full remediation costs across all units</li>
  <li>Plan for potential tenant coordination challenges</li>
  <li>Consider phasing work to manage cash flow</li>
</ul>
<p>While the clearance process may be streamlined for large properties, the commitment to full compliance remains the same for protecting all tenants.</p>
