<h2>Is lead contamination a concern in Cleveland’s soil?</h2>
<p>Yes. Lead accumulates in <strong>soil</strong> around older homes, especially near foundations where exterior paint has peeled, and in yards adjacent to high-traffic roadways or legacy industrial sites. Children can ingest contaminated soil through hand‑to‑mouth contact. For owners and investors, soil testing and controls are important parts of a comprehensive lead-safe strategy.</p>
<h3>Common soil risk areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perimeters near <strong>foundations</strong> and drip lines</li>
  <li>Play areas and garden beds</li>
  <li>Unpaved outdoor pathways and bare patches</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk reduction steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Test soil through environmental labs; prioritize child play zones.</li>
  <li><strong>Mulch or cap</strong> bare soil, plant grass cover, and relocate play equipment if needed.</li>
  <li>Maintain clean entryways to prevent tracking soil indoors; HEPA vacuum and wet clean interiors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining soil controls with interior dust controls helps keep Cleveland rentals <strong>lead-safe</strong> for families.</p>
