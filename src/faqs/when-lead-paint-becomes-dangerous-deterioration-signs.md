<h2>Lead paint deterioration and hazard development in Cleveland homes</h2>
<p>Lead-based paint becomes hazardous when it’s <strong>deteriorating</strong>—peeling, chipping, chalking, cracking, or damaged—or when it’s <strong>disturbed</strong> during repairs or renovations. Intact paint is generally lower risk, but friction and impact areas can generate dust even without visible peeling. For Cleveland landlords and investors, prompt maintenance is the most cost-effective way to prevent exposure and avoid unit downtime.</p>
<h3>Warning signs to address</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Peeling or flaking paint on walls, trim, windows, and doors</li>
  <li>Sticky windows or misaligned doors that rub and create dust</li>
  <li>Chalky residue on surfaces, baseboards, or floors</li>
  <li>Moisture damage leading to soft, crumbling paint</li>
</ul>
<h3>Owner actions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stabilize paint and correct moisture issues; use <strong>lead-safe work practices</strong>.</li>
  <li>Close out work with <strong>clearance dust-wipe testing</strong> to verify safety.</li>
  <li>Document repairs for compliance, leasing, and future diligence.</li>
</ol>
